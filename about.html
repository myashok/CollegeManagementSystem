  The Prime Minister of India constituted a National Task Force on IT and Software Development in 1998. The purpose of this committee was to make specific recommendations for the establishment of IT institutions that would produce a skilled IT workforce. The vision was to bring India to the frontier of the field of information technology.

The Ministry of Human Resources Development through its order of 1 July 1998 constituted the Rame Gowda Committee. This expert committee was to submit a project report regarding the feasibility and logistics of setting up a National Institute of Excellence in Information Technology with Allied Sciences. This Institute would carry out pioneering research and development with an emphasis on industry linkages and networking at national and international levels.

This Expert Committee met a number of times and discussed the vision and scope of the institute against the backdrop of technological innovations, particularly in the field of Information Technology. Accordingly, the decision was taken that it was an opportune moment for India to exploit and harness IT at all levels, from grass-root applications to top-notch software development.

The national task force on IT had suggested a wide spectrum of recommendations spanning from wired-village concepts to $50-billion software development programs within 6–8 years. To achieve this target, there was an urgent need for massive manpower generation. Towards this end, the Task Force had called for a number of front-ranking IT centers of excellence, of which the first was to be established in Allahabad.
